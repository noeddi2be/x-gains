# ☕️ Use Case: X-Gains

We want to create a fitness tracker with a predefined list of exercises.
Users can track their trainings as well as their progress in the application.

The application should run on GitHub Codespaces and interface with a GUI running on Budibase.
Interfacing is done using REST API's and documentation is done in Swagger UI.
